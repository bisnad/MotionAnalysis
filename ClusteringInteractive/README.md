# AI-Toolbox - Motion Analysis

The "Motion Analysis" category of the AI-Toolbox contains a collection of mostly python-based utilities for detecting body key-points in video, for deriving low and medium-level motion descriptors from motion data, for classifying motion data, and for re-organising motion according to the similarity among motion descriptors. 

The following tools are available:

- Yolo 2D Pose Estimation

- MMPose 2D and 3D Pose Estimation

- ZED 3D Pose Estimation

- Mocap Analysis

- Mocap Analysis Python

- Mocap Classifier

- Mocap Classifier Interactive

- Clustering Interactive

- Clustering Interactive Position 2D

- Nearest Neighbors
