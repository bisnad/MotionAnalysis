# AI-Toolbox - Motion Analysis - Pose Estimation

The "Motion Analysis" category of the AI-Toolbox contains a collection of mostly python-based utilities for detecting body key-points in video. These tools are grouped together in the `PoseEstimation` directory of this repository.

The following tools are available:

- [Yolo Pose Estimation](PoseEstimation/Yolo)

  A Python script that employs the Yolo 2D pose estimation model on images, movie recordings, or a live camera input

- [MMPose Pose Estimation](PoseEstimation/MMPose)

  A Python script that Employs one of the many 2D or 3D pose estimation models included in MMPose on images, movie recordings, or a live camera input

- [ZED Pose Estimation](PoseEstimation/ZED_C++)

â€‹	Several C++ applications that employ the Stereolabs 3D pose estimation model on recordings or live camera input from a ZED stereovision camera
