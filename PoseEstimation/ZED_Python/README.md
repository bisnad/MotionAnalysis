# AI-Toolbox - Motion Analysis - Pose Estimation - ZED_Python

The AI-Toolbox offers a few Python-based tools that simplify using the [Stereolab](https://www.stereolabs.com/en-ch)'s [ZED camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/en-ch/products/zed-2) as a low-end motion capture system.  All tools are based on the excellent tutorial examples provided by Stereolabs. 

The following tools are available:

- [body tracking_osc](body_tracking_osc)

  A Python-based tool for tracking performers with a single ZED camera and sending tracking data via OSC messages.

- [body_tracking_multi-camera_osc](body_tracking_multi-camera_osc)

  A Python-based tool for tracking performers with multiple ZED cameras and sending tracking data via OSC messages.
